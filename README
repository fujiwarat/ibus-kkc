ibus-kkc -- a Japanese Kana Kanji input engine for IBus
=======================================================

ibus-kkc makes the Kana Kanji conversion library (libkkc[0]) usable
through IBus.


Custom dictionaries
-------------------

ibus-kkc will look for a "dictionaries.json" file in a path consisting
of the user's config directory concatenated with the package name (the
default template for this file is at src/ibus-kkc-dictionaries.json[1]). By
default the file will be searched in "$HOME/.config/ibus-kkc/".

The "dictionaries.json" file is in JSON format and contains a list of
JSON objects describing dictionaries that can be downloaded from here[2]
(this site is in Japanese). All custom dictionary files mentioned in
"dictionaries.json" will be searched in "/usr/local/share/skk/".

The assumed default encoding of the dictionaries is "EUC-JP". If your
dictionary uses a different encoding you can add an "encoding" field
to the JSON object describing your dictionary. The value of that field
should be the name of the encoding used in your custom dictionary file.
